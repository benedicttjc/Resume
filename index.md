Benedict received the British Councilâ€™s IELTS scholarship to pursue a Bachelor of Laws at the University of Leicester, and later attained a Masters of corporate law from UCL. After graduating, Benedict undertook a research stint at the National University of Singapore, but soon returned to the UK after being awarded University of Southampton's presidential scholarship. Unfortunately, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Benedict's PhD was cut short. Benedict has since been upskilling himself in finance and technology through sponsored training from the Institute of Banking and Finance and the National University of Singapore respectively.
