Benedict holds a Master of Corporate Law from UCL and a Bachelor of Laws from the University of Leicester, attaining the latter as a British Council IELTS scholar. Graduating from law school, Benedict was recruited to study the effectiveness of Singapore Exchange's then novel mandatory sustainability reporting regime. Benedict's research abilities were recognised, and thus, he was conferred a Presidential Scholarship by the University of Southampton to pursue a PhD under the supervision of the renowned Professor, Brenda Hannigan. As a result of Covid-19 disruptions, Benedict returned to Singapore prior to completing his PhD. Benedict has since undertook training in finance and technology - from the Institute of Banking and Finance and the National University of Singapore - to enhance his analytical skills and interdisciplinary knowledge. Benedict is currently employed by the price reporting agency, Argus Media, and covers the Middle-East crude oil market.
